    <h2><a name="research">Research</a></h2>

    I am interested in connected and automated vehicles, particularly about ADAS/motion planning and control/V2X.
	I have published several journal and conference papers related to Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems and Eco-Approach 
	and Departure (EAD) application, which are listed in the "Publications" section.<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) [J1, C3, C2, C1]</strong><br>
        Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems allow connected and automated vehicles
		to communicate with each other, and coordinate their maneuvers in a form of platoon, where 
		one vehicle follows another with a constant velocity and/or time headway.<br><br>
		
		In [J1, C1], we proposed a novel CACC system based on the distributed consensus theory, where 
		distributed consensus algorithm and protocol are designed for platoon formation, merging 
		maneuvers, and splitting maneuvers. Unlike many existing CACC systems, our system only uses 
		local cooperation to achieve a global goal, hence the communication complexity is reduced.
		Moreover, different from most studies assuming the type and dynamics of all the vehicles in 
		a platoon to be homogenous, our distributed consensus algorithm takes into account the length 
		and braking ability of different vehicles. Communication delay and communication noise are also
		included in the algorithm, making the system more realistic and applicable. <br><br>
		
		In [C2], we designed a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication based Eco-CACC system, aiming to
		minimize the platoon-wide energy consumption and pollutant emissions at different stages of 
		the CACC operation. A full spectrum of environmentally-friendly CACC maneuvers are explored 
		and the associated protocols are developed, including sequence determination, gap closing and 
		opening, platoon cruising with gap regulation, and platoon joining and splitting. Compared to
		an existing CACC system, the proposed one can achieve additional 2% energy savings and additional 
		17% pollutant emissions reductions during the platoon joining scenario. <br><br>
		
		In [C3], we developed a bi-level model to investigate the optimal intra-platoon vehicle sequence 
		(i.e. position in the platoon) when each vehicle joins the platoon to minimize the total of all 
		acceleration, deceleration and cruising maneuvers of the entire platoon. In the lower level, we 
		formulate sub-problems for platoon joining and splitting to figure out minimal energy consumption 
		for gap closing and opening. In the upper level, the set of vehicles’ positions when joining the
		platoon is optimized to determine the most energy-efficient vehicle sequence during the lifecycle
		of a platoon. Simulation studies of different scenarios are conducted using MATLAB/Simulink.
		As shown in the numerical results, the optimal solution leads to 51-77% saving on incremental
		energy consumed from gap opening and closing.
        <br><br></li>
		
      <li><strong>Eco-Driving [C4, P3, P2, P1]</strong><br>
        With advanced Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication technique, "connected eco-driving"
		provides real-time advices to drivers based on real-time traffic and infrastructure conditions. 
		With connected eco-driving, even greater fuel and emission savings can be achieved without 
		compromising traffic mobility. Connected eco-driving on arterial roadways with traffic control signals
		can be referred to the so-called "Eco-Approach and Departure" technology.<br><br>
		
		In [C4], we developed a cluster-wise cooperative EAD (Coop-EAD) system to further reduce energy consumption from an 
		ego-vehicle perspective (Ego-EAD) while increasing 
		traffic throughput, compared to existing Ego-EAD applications. Instead of considering CAVs traveling through signalized 
		intersections one at a time, our approach strategically coordinates CAVs’ maneuvers to form clusters with the proposed 
		methodologies: initial vehicle clustering, intra-cluster sequence optimization, and cluster formation control. The EAD 
		algorithm is then applied to the cluster leader, and CAVs in the cluster can conduct EAD maneuvers by following the dynamics 
		of the cluster leader. A comprehensive simulation study shows that, compared to an Ego-EAD system, the proposed Coop-EAD 
		system achieves 50% increase on traffic throughput, 11% reduction on energy consumption, and up to 20% reduction on pollutant 
		emissions, respectively. <br><br>
		
		In [P1], we select specific existing traffic corridors as potential EAD deployment sites, model the overall operating 
		environment and develop a system design using a simulation environment to evaluate potential benefits and risks. We focus on simulation 
		of real-world, urban, arterial, traffic environments and integration of previous results of the Cooperative Adaptive 
		Cruise Control – Small-Scale Test (CACC-SST) Project. We propose an Eco A/D system
		architecture and algorithms that will be exercised in a vehicle / infrastructure simulation
		environment. <br><br>
		
		In [P2], we design, develop, and test an innovative vehicle-powertrain eco-operation system for 
		natural-gas-fueled plug-in hybrid electric buses. Since stop-and-go 
		operation wastes a large amount of energy, we will adopt Eco-Approach and Departure at traffic 
		signals, together with efficient adaptive cruise, and optimized stopping and accelerating from stop signs and bus stops. 
		Optimizing these maneuvers for an urban transit bus presents significant opportunities for improving energy efficiency. 
		Additionally, we will use look-ahead information on traffic and road grade to optimize the powertrain operation by managing 
		combustion engine output, electric motor output and battery state of charge in this hybrid application.<br><br>
		
		In [P3], we develop the connected eco-driving algorithms and other supporting tools for both conventional trucks and 
		PHEV trucks. The algorithms will use signal phase and timing (SPaT) information from the traffic signals on the truck
		route along with the information about the current position of the vehicle, the distance from the upcoming intersection,
		and if applicable, the distance from the preceding vehicle to determine the best course of action for passing through 
		the intersections. <br><br></li>
      
	  <li><strong>Cooperative Highway On-Ramp Merging [C5]</strong><br>
        Highway on-ramp merging is considered as one of the main factors that causes traffic congestion on highways. 
		The drivers along the on-ramp need to adjust vehicle speeds and positions to enter the highway, 
		while the drivers on the highway should also carefully accommodate vehicle speeds and positions to avoid 
		collision with the merging vehicles from the on-ramp, which heavily affects upstream traffic flows. 
		In congested traffic conditions, such maneuvers if inefficiently performed will lead to high risks 
		of accidents and excessive energy consumption and pollutant emissions.<br><br>	 

		In [C5], we present an innovative approach to this scenario, where distributed consensus protocol 
		is developed for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) to cooperate with each other by using 
		Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communications. A Road Side Unit (RSU)-equipped infrastructure installed in 
		the merging area can receive vehicles’ information from both the highway and the on-ramp using 
		Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications, and assign vehicles with sequence identifications 
		based on their estimated arrival time at the merging area. Then vehicles apply distributed consensus 
		protocol to adapt their speeds and positions to the preceding vehicles (either physical ones on the 
		same lane or “ghost” ones projected from the other lane) with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications.
		After vehicles along the on-ramp merge into the highway, a new vehicle string (either tightly-coupled or loosely-coupled) is created.<br><br></li>
